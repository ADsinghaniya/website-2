        <h4>Anonymous</h4>
        <p>Zen is a platform designed for censorship-resistant communications and anonymous economic activity.</p>
        <p>Cutting-edge cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs enable fully anonymous peer to peer communications with Zen.</p>
        <p>Zen's distributed and moderate latency networking design is highly resistant to traffic correlation and metadata analysis.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Global Publishing</h4>
        <p>The Zen blockchain enables independent and irrevocable publication of both private and publi material. After publication, material can never be suppressed, expunged, or mutated.</p>
        <p>A distributed design supports very high data survivability even in modern adverserial environments.</p>
     </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Private Economies</h4>
        <p>Transactions are supported by fully shielded zero-knowledge cryptography; meaning that recipients, senders, and balances are never disclosed.</p>
        <p>Zen is a refinement of Satoshi's ideals and implements complete and total resistance to capital control.</p>
